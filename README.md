This project aims at developing a credit risk prediction system for a Savings and Credit Cooperative (Sacco). The motivation for this project is the increasing concern over credit loan defaults as the economy grows and people's financial status improves. To address this issue, the project leverages data mining techniques to analyze a vast amount of customer data, which includes basic information, social connections, consumption behavior, and address information, all of which can be valuable in assessing borrowers' creditworthiness. The primary objective of this system is to predict the credit risk associated with individual customers. This prediction is made possible by allowing customers to input specific data into the system, which will then generate an output indicating their credit risk. This prediction model is built by training machine learning algorithms on historical data accumulated by the Sacco through its previous experiences with borrowers. The project considers using s random forests algorithm. This algorithm will be applied to the historical data to identify the most effective model for predicting personal credit risk.
In summary, this project seeks to create a credit risk prediction system for a Taifa Sacco by mining and analyzing extensive customer data. It aims to provide a user-friendly interface for customers to input their information and receive a credit risk assessment. The project will evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms to select the best model for this predictive system. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the Sacco's ability to assess and manage credit risk effectively, thereby promoting responsible lending practices and reducing defaults.
